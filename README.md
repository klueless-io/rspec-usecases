# Rspec Usecases

> null

This GEM is inspired by the Javascript Library [handlebars-helpers](https://github.com/helpers/handlebars-helpers).

I am following a lot of the categories found there, but this GEM is not a one for one match to the existing JS library as I feel it is a bit dated and could use some new helpers and categories may be relevant today.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'rspec-usecases'
```

And then execute:

```bash
bundle install
```

Or install it yourself as:

```bash
gem install rspec-usecases
```

## Stories

### Main Story

## Usage

See all [usage examples](./USAGE.md)



## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

`rspec-usecases` is setup with Guard, run `guard`, this will watch development file changes and run tests automatically, if successful, it will then run rubocop for style quality.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
